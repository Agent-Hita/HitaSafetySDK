/**
 * Detects when a contact activates disappearing/ephemeral message mode.
 *
 * This is a significant warning sign: someone enabling message deletion is
 * attempting to hide the conversation history from guardians, parents, or
 * the user themselves. Scored HIGH by default when confirmed activation is
 * detected — no multi-signal arc required.
 *
 * Signal sources:
 *   - System notification text from WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Telegram
 *   - In-conversation requests to switch to disappearing/ephemeral mode
 *   - "View once" image/video requests (hide evidence after viewing)
