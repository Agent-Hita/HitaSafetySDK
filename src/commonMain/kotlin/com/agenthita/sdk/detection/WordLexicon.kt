/**
 * Category-specific word-level lexicon for order-independent scoring.
 *
 * Each category holds a map of stem/root words → weight [0.0, 1.0].
 * High-weight words are strong individual signals (e.g. "nude", "extort").
 * Low-weight words only matter when several appear together (e.g. "trust",
 * "situation", "forever").
 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - Words should be roots/stems so they match inflections (transfer, transferred)
 *  - Avoid single-letter words and extremely common words (is, the, you)
 *  - A word may appear in multiple categories with different weights
 *  - The score() function sums matched weights and normalises by the same
 *    divisor (3.0) used by phrase detectors, keeping scales consistent
 *
 * Maintenance: add new words here only. No code logic changes needed.
